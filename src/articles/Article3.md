<p> You're so vain.. I bet you think this article is about me. <br> Well, you're correct. <em> It is. </em> <br> 
Just kidding. I'm not <em> thee</em> great Elon Musk. But I have the same name. So, that is why I would like to outline why I like Elon Musk <em> (the real one, that is)</em> and why you should, too. <br>
<strong> Reason 1: </strong>  <br>
He has a really interesting backstory. He's South African and found hope in the American dream, so emigrated to America to start a new life. <br>
<strong> Reason 2: </strong> <br>
His dedication, persistence and work ethic is <strong><em> insane</em></strong>. He often logs 80-90 work weeks while still maintaining a close relationship with his kids (to the point of bringing them along on his crazy adventures) and never gives up after a set back like bankruptcy, getting kicked out of a company. Everyone can be inspired somewhat to these traits in him.
<br> No one is perfect. There are many different sides to people, and I'm sure he has his bad sides as well. <br>While, I don't necessarily like promoting grind culture, I still find motivation in his journey. Seeing someone put in 150% into their passion even after countless setbacks, where any normal person would throw in the towel, is so inspiring. It is in some ways, the person I would like to be, too.  <br> 
That is why I like him, and hope that it inspires you to be the best <strong> you</strong>, that you can be!
