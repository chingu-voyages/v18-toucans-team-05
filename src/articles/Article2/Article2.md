<h3> For Mockups: Adobe XD </h3>
<p> Mockups are an important part of development. It's very important to get a sense of what you want your final project to look like and to plan the functional aspects of your project before you start. It saves a lot of time and hassle for your whole team. </p>
<h3> For Task MGMT: ZenHub </h3>
<p> Whether working in a team or solo, every developer needs a way to plan out what to do next on a project. ZenHub is a great go to for task MGMT, task assignment and task relevance and is built directly into Git Hub! Helps get those epic projects sorted ASAP. </p>
<h3> For Coding: Visual Studio Code </h3>
<p> Visual Studio Code is a great way to code. It allows you to use an array of languages, extensions, and integrates seamlessly with other developer tools. It even allows for screen share and collaboration mode for those tricky projects. A must have!
